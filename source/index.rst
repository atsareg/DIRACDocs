DIRAC v5 Documentation
=====================================

The DIRAC (Distributed Infrastructure with Remote Agent Control) project is a complete Grid solution for a community of users such as the LHCb Collaboration. DIRAC forms a layer between a particular community and various compute resources to allow optimized, transparent and reliable usage.

`A high level overview <https://lhcbweb.pic.es/DIRAC/info/general/diracOverview>`_ gives a general idea
of the DIRAC functionality. A more detailed description of the DIRAC system can be found at this 
`location <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/LHCb/DiracProjectPage/DIRAC_CHEP07_mod5.pdf>`_.

The DIRAC Workload Management system realizes the task scheduling paradigm with Generic Pilot Jobs ( or Agents ). 
This task scheduling method solves many problems of using unstable distributed computing resources which are 
available in computing grids. In particular, it helps the management of the user activities in large Virtual 
Organizations such as LHC experiments. In more details the DIRAC WMS with Pilot Jobs is described 
`here <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/LHCb/DiracProjectPage/DIRAC_Pilots_Note.pdf>`_.
